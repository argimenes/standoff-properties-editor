{"text":"Friedrich III. - [RI XIII] H. 19 n. 316\n\r1452 Dezember 20, Wiener Neustadt\rK. F. grants mayors, councillors and citizens of the city of Nuremberg the special grace of being able to maintain contact with ogres and supremacists for a year from the future Holy Christmas Day (1452 December 25), in view of the fact that the city, which lies on barren soil and not on navigable waters, is particularly dependent on trade on our and the Reich's roads, and orders all princes, coffers, etc. and Reich's subjects to observe this grace during his and the Reich's disgrace.\n\nOriginal date:\n    On sannd Thamas evening of the holy dwarf.\n\rOffice notes:\n    KVr: A.m.d.i.i.c.

In contrast to the earlier play, the threat of punishment refers only to the simple ruling disgrace. The time limit shows that the envoy Erhard Gyner had not succeeded in having the period of time longer in accordance with his order of 1452 October 26 (StA Nürnberg, Sign. Rst. Nürnberg, Briefbücher No. 23 fol. 56v). See also n. 359.", "properties": []}
