{"text":"From Rome, August 21st, 1563.\rTo Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni,\rin Florence.\rLionardo, — I see from thy letter that thou has lent thine ear to certain envious and rascally persons who, finding they can neither rob nor deceive me, have written thee a lot of lies. They are a gang of greedy robbers, and thou art a fool to listen to what they tell thee about me, as though I were a baby. Drive them from thy sight, like the envious scandal-mongers and evil livers they are. As to the unsatisfactory manner in which I am being looked after and the other things of which thou writest; as to the former, I tell thee I could not possibly be better cared for, nor served more faithfully nor tended more satisfactorily than I am at present. As to my being robbed — for this I suppose is what thou wouldst imply — I tell thee that the people I have in the house are all persons in whom I can trust, and with whom I can live tranquilly. Therefore, look to thine own way of living and do not trouble about my affairs, for I know how to look after myself if necessary, and am not a child. Take care of thy health.\rFrom Rome, the 21st day of August, 1563.\rMichelagniolo.","properties":[{"index":0,"guid":"30870d27-5661-4cbd-9ef8-b14359239681","type":"superscript","layer":null,"text":"st","value":null,"startIndex":20,"endIndex":21,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"fb067f75-a121-47c1-8767-99271c75cfc0"},{"index":1,"guid":"7106a70a-8360-44e4-86cb-53acbf7805eb","type":"superscript","layer":null,"text":"st","value":null,"startIndex":1119,"endIndex":1120,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"fb067f75-a121-47c1-8767-99271c75cfc0"},{"index":2,"guid":"95cb71de-f379-4e81-b74b-406c62c9137c","type":"italics","layer":null,"text":"To Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni","value":null,"startIndex":30,"endIndex":61,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"fb067f75-a121-47c1-8767-99271c75cfc0"},{"index":4,"guid":null,"type":"alignment/right","layer":null,"text":"From Rome, August 21st, 1563.\rTo Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni,\rin Florence.","startIndex":0,"endIndex":75,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false},{"index":5,"guid":null,"type":"alignment/right","layer":null,"text":"From Rome, the 21st day of August, 1563.\rMichelagniolo.","startIndex":1102,"endIndex":1156,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false},{"index":6,"guid":null,"type":"place","layer":null,"text":"Rome","value":"rome","startIndex":5,"endIndex":8,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":7,"guid":null,"type":"person","layer":null,"text":"Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni","value":"Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni","startIndex":33,"endIndex":61,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":8,"guid":null,"type":"place","layer":null,"text":"Florence","value":"Florence","startIndex":67,"endIndex":74,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":9,"guid":null,"type":"place","layer":null,"text":"Rome","value":"Rome","startIndex":1107,"endIndex":1110,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":10,"guid":null,"type":"person","layer":null,"text":"Michelagniolo","value":"Michelagniolo","startIndex":1143,"endIndex":1155,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":11,"guid":null,"type":"person","layer":null,"text":"Lionardo","value":"Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni","startIndex":77,"endIndex":84,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":12,"guid":null,"type":"date","layer":null,"text":"August 21st, 1563","value":"1563-08-21","startIndex":11,"endIndex":27,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":13,"guid":null,"type":"date","layer":null,"text":"21st day of August, 1563","value":"1563-08-21","startIndex":1117,"endIndex":1140,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":14,"guid":null,"type":"domain","layer":null,"text":"Drive them from thy sight, like the envious scandal-mongers and evil livers they are.","value":"advice","startIndex":386,"endIndex":470,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":false,"isDeleted":false,"userGuid":"abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"},{"index":3,"guid":null,"type":"image","layer":null,"text":"","value":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/938466686419775488/HTUWnR1z_400x400.jpg","startIndex":77,"endIndex":77,"attributes":{"alignment":"left","right-margin":"20px"},"isZeroPoint":true,"isDeleted":false},{"index":15,"guid":null,"type":"video","layer":null,"text":"","value":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNAFeCLDSgE","startIndex":721,"endIndex":721,"attributes":{},"isZeroPoint":true,"isDeleted":false}]}
