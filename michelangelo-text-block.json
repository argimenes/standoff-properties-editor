{"text":"From Rome, August 21st, 1563.\rTo Lionardo di Buonarroto Simoni,\rin Florence.\rLionardo, — I see from thy letter that thou has lent thine ear to certain envious and rascally persons who, finding they can neither rob nor deceive me, have written thee a lot of lies. They are a gang of greedy robbers, and thou art a fool to listen to what they tell thee about me, as though I were a baby. Drive them from thy sight, like the envious scandal-mongers and evil livers they are. As to the unsatisfactory manner in which I am being looked after and the other things of which thou writest; as to the former, I tell thee I could not possibly be better cared for, nor served more faithfully nor tended more satisfactorily than I am at present. As to my being robbed — for this I suppose is what thou wouldst imply — I tell thee that the people I have in the house are all persons in whom I can trust, and with whom I can live tranquilly. Therefore, look to thine own way of living and do not trouble about my affairs, for I know how to look after myself if necessary, and am not a child.
